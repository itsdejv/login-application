# login-application
Hello,

This is my simple login application which I've created.
In this project i used OOP, to improve clarity of the project.

The project also contains simple editing profile page, where you can edit your profiles.

In addition to the login system, the app also provides an easy way to add photos to the gallery and possibly delete photos from the gallery.

Project uses:
    localhosted database called "LoginApplication"
        table "users"
        table "profiles"
        table "gallery"
